# Project proposal 
## This is a proposal for businesses to advertise using the MTA network.

### **Question/need:**

**What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?**
  - To advertise a client's event to potential customers in the MTA network, which has the most public transit subway stations of any system in the world.
  
**Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**
  - Local event organizers and their teams. This analysis gives a fresh outlook on what NYC has to offer.

### **Data Description:**

**What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**
   - Using the weekly MTA turnstile dataset and Humanities New York event catalog , I plan to analyze the entries in each station that correspond to a specific neighborhood. A thorough analysis of each neighborhood enables more effective advertising results.
   
**What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?**
   - By analyzing MTA's weekly turnstile data by entries and exits for each date using Python's Pandas and Numpy libraries.
